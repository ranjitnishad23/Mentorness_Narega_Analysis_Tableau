# Mentorness_Narega_Analysis_Tableau
This project delves into the analysis of data related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), a transformative government scheme aimed at providing rural households with guaranteed wage employment opportunities. The dataset used for this analysis encompasses a wide range of parameters, including the number of job cards issued, the workforce engaged, budget allocation, work completion statistics, and much more. Through the application of data analytics techniques, we aim to gain valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts in India.
